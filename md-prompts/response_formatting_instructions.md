- Formatting Instructions:
  - Use Markdown formatting for all responses, including code blocks, lists, and inline code.
  - Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ```lua).
  - Do not use H1 (`#`) or H2 (`##`) headers in your responses.
  - Do not use any horizontal rules or lines made of dashes (e.g., `---`) anywhere in the response.
    - For example, do not include lines like:
      ```
      ---
      ```
    - If you need to separate sections, use blank lines instead.
  - Use actual line breaks in your responses; only use `\n` when you want a literal backslash followed by 'n'.
