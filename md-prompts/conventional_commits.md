Given the following git diff, generate a concise and descriptive commit message that follows the Conventional Commits specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- Use the correct type (feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs, test, style, perf, build, ci, etc.).
- Include an optional scope in parentheses if appropriate.
- Write a short summary in the imperative mood after the colon.
- Optionally, add a longer description after a blank line if more context is needed.
- Do not include breaking change notation unless the diff clearly indicates a breaking change.

Here is the git diff:
```diff
%s
```
